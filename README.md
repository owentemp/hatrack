# HatRack App
#### Wear your many hats.

### Overview:

A productivity app to improve focus and encourage deliberate practice.

### Getting Started:

For most of us, our life and work requires "wearing multiple hats", that is, there are multiple roles or task categories we need to perform on a daily basis. 

For example, some jobs require: Selling, Preparing Estimates, Providing Technical Support, and Expense Reporting. As another example, some other jobs require: Writing, Shipping, Booking, Reading.

Think about the activities that should happen on a daily basis in your life - the "hats" you need to wear on a daily basis - to keep your life going smoothly.

These "hats" or recurring activities usually end in "-ing", as in Emailing, Designing, etc. or they are project names.

What is the name of 1 hat that you need to wear on a regular basis in your work? Examples: Coding, Writing, Selling. Enter the name of the hat into the text input box and click "Add Hat to Rack."

What is another activity you need to do on a daily basis? Enter the name of the hat into the text input box and click "Add Hat to Rack."

Add a few more "hats" and then, when you are ready to focus on working on them, click the "Focus Session" button to have one hat drawn at random, and a focus session from 1 to 25 minutes will be chosen for you.
